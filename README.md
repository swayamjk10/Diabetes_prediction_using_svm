# Diabetes_prediction_using_svm
## Introduction
Early diagnosis and prediction of diabetes can significantly improve the quality of life for patients. This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes using the SVM algorithm on the Pima Indians Diabetes Database.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database (PIMA dataset), which contains several medical predictor variables and one target variable indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.

## Methodology
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Initial data analysis and handling of missing values.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Feature scaling and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
3. **Model Building**: Implementing the SVM algorithm and hyperparameter tuning.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using various metrics.

## Results
The SVM model achieved an accuracy of X%, precision of Y%, recall of Z%, and an F1-score of W%. The model's performance is evaluated and compared with other classifiers.

## Conclusion
The SVM algorithm proves to be an effective method for predicting diabetes. Future work can focus on improving model accuracy and exploring other machine learning algorithms.
